I'm the CTO at [Axiomatics](https://github.com/axiomatics "Axiomatics's Github page"), the leaders in fine-grained authorization. Prior to taking on the CTO role, I ran Customer Identity (CIAM) at Salesforce. My main focus is identity & access management (IAM) and API security.

I've published several papers and contributed to several books on API security, identity, and attribute-based access control. I also contribute to several identity standards including OAuth, SCIM, ALFA, and XACML. I am a regular speaker at conferences including Identiverse, Gartner IAM summits, and the European Identity Conference. Check out my blog on identity and access at [Webfarmr](https://www.webfarmr.eu "Harvesting web technologies").
